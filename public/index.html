          On Playstation, games typically group their achievements into multiple categories to account
          for things such as multiplayer or DLC achievements. This system allows for players who don't
          have multiplayer capabilities, don't own the DLC, or want to play games with dead online servers
          to still obtain the Platinum for the main game. However, Steam doesn't have this system, so
          players are forced to gather every achievement if they want to see the shiny ribbon on their
          profile. This website makes it so that you can see your Platinum equivalents on Steam, and
          also see your combined Platinums from both PSN and Steam as if you were playing only on PSN!
          Note that some games have multiplayer integrated into their base game achievements still
          (like DOOM or Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag).
